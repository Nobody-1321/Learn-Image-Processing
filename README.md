# Image Processing

Image processing is a fascinating field that blends mathematics, algorithms, and computer science to enhance and analyze images. While it can be complex, understanding the fundamental techniques makes it an exciting and rewarding area to explore.

This repository is designed for educational purposes, focusing on teaching the algorithms behind image processing rather than providing highly optimized code. The implementations prioritize clarity and readability to help learners grasp the core concepts without unnecessary complexity.
